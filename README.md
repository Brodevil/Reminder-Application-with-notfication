# Motivation
- I had created the program just for personal use as the mordern Arlam system application take too much ram in compare to build your own using python.<br>
- I suppose to use to notifite my self for any work or anything this is just too much helpful.<br>
- I created it to run in the backend using less RAM without GUI, So I suppose to read the [Exel file](https://github.com/Brodevil/Reminder-Application-with-notfication/blob/master/Remind_data.xlsx) As to get data from there and just notifite me.<br>
- And had sort down my daily work and run in the morning and tha program work till night for me.<br><br>

# How to use
- The first step will be to fork this repository and then install the zip file or even you can clone it using git `git clone https://github.com/Brodevil/Reminder-Application-with-notfication/`.<br>
- Then in that directory you just run the following command in your terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt`.<br>
- The next step will to just open the `Remind_data.xlsx` And you have to fill your time in the first column and reasone for reminding in the second column.<br>
- You can just use to column 1st for the time and 2nd for the pourpose but you can use several rows as much you want its depend how many Work you have to remind.<br>
- For Exmaple, in [that](https://github.com/Brodevil/Reminder-Application-with-notfication/blob/master/Remind_data.xlsx) Exel file you will get few Stored data and you can easily get understand by seeing them.<br>
- And now you save that file and just to run the python program in the backend (Note : It just take 2 to 3 MB ram of your system while running in the backgrond)<br>
- Run the following command in the terminal `pythonw.exe .\main.py` This is run the program in backend even you close the terminal or IDE till the PC get shutdown.<br>
- And just get the benefit for the program as it will notifite you time to time.<br><br>
